    "body": "Once per floor, you may spend up to one floor cooking a dish using 1–3 monster parts harvested in that floor or earlier. Choose one of the following ability checks: Cooking (Constitution check): standard difficulty; success grants the party a temporary buff. Culinary Intuition (Intelligence or Wisdom check): creative preparation that grants advantage on the buff roll or an enhanced effect. Risky Delicacy (Charisma check, DC 16): an experimental or dangerous recipe; success grants the buff and +1d6 temporary hit points, while failure causes nausea (disadvantage on one roll). Buff options (1 floor duration): +1d4 to attack rolls; +1d6 to AC (maximum 18); healing that restores 1d8 + party size hit points; or resistance to a damage type of the party's choice. The buff does not take effect until it is consumed. If the cook rolls a 1, the dish is spoiled and each party member must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or suffer poisoning, imposing disadvantage on checks for one floor.",

On a success, your weapon strikes a vital point and the target is instantly reduced to 0 hit points with no saving throw—it dies outright.
